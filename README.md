Project Description

This project is an online quiz and learning platform with both user and administrator functionalities. Students can register, take quizzes, view their scores and correct answers, and access study resources. The platform features a leaderboard, student profiles, and automated feedback with suggestions for improvement. Quizzes are scheduled and have an expiration date, with reminders sent to users. Quizzes also have different difficulty levels (Hard, Medium, Easy). Additionally, the system includes an auto-submission feature for quizzes. Admins have full control over quiz and question management, including the ability to create, edit, and delete quizzes, as well as add multiple-choice questions with options (A, B, C, D).
